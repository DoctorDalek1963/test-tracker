# TestTracker

This application is designed to provide a web interface to a database of past paper completion
statuses. IT DOES NOT STORE PAST PAPERS THEMSELVES - it only stores data about which papers a
person has done.

The first time you open the website, you create an account, and then you can populate your
collection with a list of past papers. Each paper here has a name, a completion status, and an
optional link to the paper and/or the mark scheme, as well as other data, such as your final mark
for the paper and when you did it.

The completion status of each paper is the most important part. TestTracker is designed to help you
keep track of which papers you've already completed and which ones you're yet to complete.
